# GerberExporter
A library to export Gerber file shapes into a more friendly format which can converted to other formats like STL or SVG.

# Project Status
The exporter is in development, circles have been implemented at this time.  So you can input a gerber and get out a STL or SVG  containging all the circles elements from the gerber.  I will be adding other shapes to this soon. 

Below is a sample of the exported STL
